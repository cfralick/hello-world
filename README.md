Hello World
===========

The first lines of code I wrote in various languages. 

Individually, they are failures. Together, they are a timeless reminder of what it means to learn and to grow:  

* the dumber you feel, the stupider you look
* the longer you work, the less you achieve
* and the harder you try, the worse you fail  


Except for my first tries at PHP and Javascript. I lost those.
