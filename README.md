Hello World
===========

The first lines of code I wrote in various languages. 

Individually, they are failures. Together, they are a reminder that the dumber you feel, the stupider you look; the longer you work, the less you achieve; and the harder you try, the worse you fail.  

Except for my first tries at PHP and Javascript. I lost those.
